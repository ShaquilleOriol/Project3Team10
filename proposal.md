# Project 3 Proposal

## Project Title 
What's For Tomorrow!

## User Story

As a User, It's Sunday and I know that I have a very hectic week ahead. How can I find time to create a meal plan and shop for ingredients for everyday of the week? We created What's for Tomorrow! to help consumers create a realistic meal plan for Monday through Sunday.  

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I'm on my homepage
WHEN I'm not logged in
THEN I need to either log in or create an account.
WHEN I'm on my logged in homepage
THEN I search recipes based on my preference or a surprise me choice
THEN I can save/delete recipes on my user database.
THEN I can take 7 recipes and save onto my meal calendar for the week
THEN it will generate a shopping list with the 7 recipe's ingredients
FINALLY I can text or email the shopping list to myself for easy use at the store
```

## Project Description 
```
A website that allows you to log in, search for recipes based on your preference or a surprise me choice, then I can save on my page to add to my weekly calendar, once I decide on my 7 choices that I save to my calendar, it will generate a shopping list that I can email to myself to use at the store.
```
